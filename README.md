This is a a JRPG inspired mystery game where you have to deduce the murderer. This game was build during Game Jam project of Outscal.

##  Gameplay

In this game, you play as **Detective Ida** and she has been called in this mansion to solve the murder of this 18 year old girl Amanda.

The game core mechanic consists of -

1. You have to walk towards the other family members to interact

2. You can also move closer to objects to interact
  

##  Powerups

Here comes the Game Jam topic '**Special Powerups**. Detective Ida is equipped with two special powers -

1. She has an inbuild lie detector which, once the conversation ends gets activated and you get the choice if the family member is saying '**True**' or '**False**'

2. Second is '**History Magnifier**, when she is close to certain objects she can read who all touched the object before and description of the object itself.

## Architecture
The codebase comprises of following Design patterns - 
1. MVC pattern for Detective and NPC
2. Singleton patter for script communication
3. Observer pattern for various interaction events  

##  Notes

The game for now is a small single room adventure, but my goal was to achieve conversation mechanic and able to build something like this and it has been pretty exciting building this.
