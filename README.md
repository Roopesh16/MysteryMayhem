This game is part of Outscal Unity Fundamentals MAT 2 Assignment
## Gameplay
This is a murder mystery adventure game inspired by JRPG style.
In this game, you play as **Detective Ida** and she has been called in this mansion to solve the murder of this 18 year old girl Amanda.

The game core mechanic consists of - 
1. You have to walk towards the other family members to interact
2. You can also move closer to objects to interact

## Powerups
Here comes the Game Jam topic '**Special Powerups**. Detective Ida is equipped with two special powers - 
1. She has an inbuild lie detector which, once the conversation ends gets activated and you get the choice if the family member is saying '**True**' or '**False**'
2. Second is '**History Magnifier**, when she is close to certain objects she can read who all touched the object before and description of the object itself.

## Notes
The game for now is a small single room adventure, but my goal was to achieve conversation mechanic and able to build something like this and it has been pretty exciting building this. You can watch gameplay video to see the gameplay.
