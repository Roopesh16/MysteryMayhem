    "I was on my bed reading a book, it was given to me by Amanda.",
    "I did, I insisted on Amanda's father to make her the heir, I don't trust her mother with that kind of money.",

    "At early morning, I woke up as usual and I heard a creak from Amanda room and there was a loud scream of Blonte, then I got to know my love Amanda was dead!"
